# SimpleBackup
A simple backup tool written in Python 3 (Python 2 also available)

This command line backup tool can make snapshots of specified directories and can compare different snapshots and copy the new files to somewhere else.

Should work for all platforms that support Python.

Use the `master` branch for Python 3, and use the `python2` branch for Python 2.

Note: the Python 2 version does not support unicode filenames.
